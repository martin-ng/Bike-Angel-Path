# Stackathon-Bike-Angel-Path

<h3>Background</h3>
This is personal project designed to be built in 2 days for a hackathon. 

I love cycling and a member of Citi's Citibike bike-share program located in NYC and NJ metro region. Considering it is a bike-share system, it does have flaws such as overcrowding and lack of bikes at certain docks. To encourage riders to distribute bikes evenly,
the Bike Angel program was employed. Bike Angels are Citi Bike riders who improve the availability of bikes and 
docks for fellow riders and earn rewards along the way. Angels earn points for taking bikes from crowded stations and
bringing them to empty ones or stations expected to soon become empty. 

Bike Angel Path was originally designed to provide riders an interface to locate regions with the highest frequency of points,
as well as the shortest path to the next dock. 

<h3>MVP</h3>
The MVP of this project was to create a mobile app that allowed riders to filter out docks depending on the point value. Then the rider will then receive directions to the nearest dock that will maximize the potential earnings. To achieve this, I utilized React Native as the front-end framework to write code that will work on both iOS and Android devices. 

<h3>Current Development</h3>
This application currently only allows users to view docks and filter depending on the user's input. This app is still under development in terms of implementing back-end logic in conjunction with Google Maps API.
