# Stackathon-Bike-Angel-Path

This is a personal project formed due to an interest in cycling.

Citibike is a bike-share program located in NYC and NJ metro region. To encourage riders to distribute bikes evenly,
the Bike Angel program was employed. Bike Angels are Citi Bike riders who improve the availability of bikes and 
docks for fellow riders and earn rewards along the way. Angels earn points for taking bikes from crowded stations and
bringing them to empty ones or stations expected to soon become empty. 

Bike Angel Path was created to provide riders an interface to locate regions with the highest frequency of points,
as well as the shortest path to the next dock.
